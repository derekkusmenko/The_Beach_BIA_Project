# The Beach BIA Project

This project, led by Derek Kusmenko and Arusan Surendiran, focuses on understanding human movement patterns within the Beaches Business Improvement Area (BIA) in Toronto. In collaboration with Dr. Johanna Carlo, we collect various datasets from the City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal, including transit delays, bike-share ridership, and traffic patterns within The Beach BIA.
